## 2.1 Concepts foundations (Semantic web  vs. relational database)
- Semantic web is an extension of the World Wide Web standards, which promote common data formats and exchange protocols on the Web, most fundamentally the Resource Description Framework (RDF) is used to store data.
- A relational database is a set of formally described related tables from which data can be accessed or reassembled.
- Most fundamentally RDF uses SPARQL (Simple Protocol and Rdf Query Language) to read stored data while relational databases uses SQL (Structured Query Language) to do so.
- In SQL relational database terms, RDF data can also be considered or viewed as a table with only three columns – the subject column, the predicate column, and the object column.

## 2.2 Concepts foundations (RDF and RDF triples)

 - The RDF is a conceptual data model that is based on the idea of making statements about resources in expressions of the form (subject–predicate–object), known as triples.
 - The subject denotes the resource, and the predicate denotes traits or aspects of the resource, and expresses a relationship between the subject and the object.
 - RDF data are stored on containers known as triplestores.

## 2.4 How Wikidata compares with other data sets 

## DISCUSSION: ##
* There are already clashes with the previous module
* Option 1: set focus or on the usage of it for librarians
* Option 2: merge this completely into Module 1
* Option 3: Put to the end (later module)
