# Design decision

Sometime there is more than one way to do something. Here are some
reason why we did certain things in a certain manner.

# Edit first vs. create first

In order to lower the hurdle for first edit the idea was suggested on
the WikiCite 2019 brain storming that at first a exiting article
should be edited and then later a new one should be created. This
comes with the disadvantage, that either the participants work on
rather different items (e.g. find something via the random item link)
or the instructor has to pick/create for each participant a suiting
item. Due to this we decided to rather start with the creation of new
items in the Wikidata test instance (which needs only 4 fields to be
filled out).
